## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
C is my native language. I speak C++, Python, and a bit of Java. Currently, I'm learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

I'm working on a website to correct all the math exam problems from the BAC in every country, with detailed solutions that include clickable links for each step of the reasoning process, leading to the applied property for the respective step.
